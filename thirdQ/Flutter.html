        <p>This Flutter Tutorial is specifically designed for beginners and experienced professionals. It covers both the basics and advanced concepts of the Flutter framework.

            Flutter is Google’s Mobile SDK to build native iOS and Android apps from a single codebase. 
            It was developed on December 4, 2018. When building applications with Flutter, everything is towards Widgets – the blocks with which the Flutter apps are built. 
            The User Interface of the app comprises many simple widgets, each handling one particular job.
             That is why Flutter developers tend to think of their Flutter app
              as a tree of devices.</p>
